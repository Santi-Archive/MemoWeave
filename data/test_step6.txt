Once upon a time, in a small village, John woke up early. He walked to the market before sunrise. 

At the market, Mary was already selling fresh bread. John bought a loaf from her. They talked about the upcoming festival.

Later that day, Sarah arrived at the village square. The sun had set by then. She met with John at the tavern. They discussed their travel plans for tomorrow.
